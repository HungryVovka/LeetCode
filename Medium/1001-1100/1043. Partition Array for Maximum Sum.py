# 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum
# 
# Given an integer array arr, partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most 
# k. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value 
# of that subarray.
# 
# Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning. Test cases are generated so that 
# the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3
# Output: 84
# Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4
# Output: 83
# 
# Example 3:
# Input: arr = [1], k = 1
# Output: 1
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 1 <= arr.length <= 500
# 0 <= arr[i] <= 109
# 1 <= k <= arr.length
